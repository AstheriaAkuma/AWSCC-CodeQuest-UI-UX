Remember, you're free to add your personal touch, but keep the sacred requirements intact; they are the guardians of order here. This markdown file should or may include:

#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: Shopee is better because it has the categories section right up front, while on Lazada, you have to scroll down to find it. This makes it quicker to find stuff on Shopee, making the experience better overall.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: Lazada's homepage can overwhelming with ads and a cluttered layout, making finding categories a bit confusing due to their placement. Shopee, on the other hand, might distract users with flashy deals and multiple sections, possibly diverting users from straightforward category navigation.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: Shopee organizes things better than Lazada. Shopee's layout helps you read and understand easily because it's clear and well-sectioned. Lazada, on the other hand, might feel messy and not as easy to figure out, which can slow down the user when they're trying to find their way around.
    
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: Both are visually appealing and I can see the difference between them and both have their own "Labeling" to their brand. Each platform stands out with its unique visual style, allowing users to easily recognize and differentiate between the two.
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices. <br/>
    Answer: Both platforms effectively optimize their layouts, allowing users to seamlessly access their services regardless of the device they're using.
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer: I find Shopee more visually appealing due to its organized layout and the effective use of orange, a color symbolizing optimism. Lazada also employs a compelling blend of blue and orange, representing both optimism and trustworthiness. But I like shopee more.
